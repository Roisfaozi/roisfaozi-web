          Hi! I'm Rois Faozi. I have a strong passion for technology. I
          specialize in Front End Development and my passion is all about
          building elegant and professional user interfaces and websites.
          <br /> <br /> I live in the Indonesia. I'm interested in web
          development since 10 years, and always find out about web development.
          It fascinated me and it hooked me on, so I decided to pursue this
          career. Started 3 years ago I decided to move my career as a Frontend
          developer after 5 years as a designer. In development I'm passionate
          to bring both the technical aspects and the visual aesthetic. User
          experience, accessibility with good functionalityis important to me.
          Combining the state of the art and my programming knowledge, I am able
          to build a professional and interactive website. <br /> <br /> When
          I'm not in front of a computer screen, I'm probably playing game with
          my friends, watch some show and movie.
